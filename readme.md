## COLD(name in progress)

This is COLD, a game for the TI-84 PLUS CE, it requires libload, so make sure that you have that installed. It is in C.

It is a survial game, it saves progress, and if its not realsed yet, I would be careful to make it yourself.

Its got two modes, Story and Freeplay
In story you have to survive 7 days, completing diffrent challanges in order to get rescued by your team
In freeplay, you just survive as long as you can, which is infinite

##Tips:
1. Your axe is the most important thing you have, it is used for farming materials and most processes/interactions in the game
2. The story mode challanges are similar to 1, just walk around swinging your axe and it should work out pretty well
3. Beer is the most important food you can have in freeplay, you sacrifice a bit of health, but you get soo much food and heat
4. Diagonal walk to go faster

## Controls:
- The diffrent function buttons are for inventory
- Arrows to move
- Use mode to drop a useable item
- 2nd is the action key, use it to do anything
- Clear to quit
- Enter in menus
- Hidden, you can do a little emote with division symbol
- Axe stumps for wood, bushes for berrys, barrles for beer
- Radio is only really for story mode
- Fire creates a fire that warms while it consumes wood, can be refueled and picked up
- Berries can be eaten, dropped, or turned into beer
- Wood can be used to fix buildings, dropped, fuel fires, and is needed to start fires
- Beer can be drank or dropped
- The white box and green circle are story mode things representing gettting the black box, and activating radio control
